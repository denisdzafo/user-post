    The test assignment was easy to make and it was similar to things that I'm doing regularly. I didn't focus on the frontend part of the task, my main focus was on the backend development since the frontend part was the main focus on test 2.  In database seeding, you have a test user with credentials "test@test.com", "000000". The estimated time was around 5 hours.
